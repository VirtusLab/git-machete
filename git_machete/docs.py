        <b>Usage: git machete add [-o|--onto=<target-upstream-branch>] [-R|--as-root] [-y|--yes] [<branch>]</b>

        Adds the provided <branch> (or the current branch, if none specified) to the definition file.
        If <branch> is provided but no local branch with the given name exists:
        * if a remote branch of the same name exists in exactly one remote, then user is asked whether to check out this branch locally (as in `git checkout`),
        * otherwise, user is asked whether it should be created as a new local branch.

        If the definition file is empty or `-R`/`--as-root` is provided, the branch will be added as a root of the tree of branch dependencies.
        Otherwise, the desired upstream (parent) branch can be specified with `-o`/`--onto`.
        Neither of these options is mandatory, however; if both are skipped, git machete will try to automatically infer the target upstream.
        If the upstream branch can be inferred, the user will be presented with inferred branch and asked to confirm.

        Note: all the effects of `add` (except git branch creation) can as well be achieved by manually editing the definition file.

        <b>Options:</b>
          <b>-o, --onto=<target-upstream-branch></b>    Specifies the target parent branch to add the given branch onto.
                                                 Cannot be specified together with `-R`/`--as-root`.

        <b>Usage: git machete advance [-y|--yes]</b>

        Fast forwards (as in `git merge --ff-only`) the current branch `C` to match its downstream `D`,
        and subsequently slides out `D`. Both steps require manual confirmation unless `-y`/`--yes` is provided.

        The downstream `C` is selected according to the following criteria:
        * if `C` has exactly one downstream branch `d` whose tip is a descendant of `C`, and whose fork point is equal to `C` or is overridden
          (basically: there's a green edge between `C` and `d`), then `d` is selected as `D`,
        * if `C` has no downstream branches connected with a green edge to `C`, then `advance` fails,
        * if `C` has more than one downstream branch connected with a green edge to `C`,
          then user is asked to pick the branch to fast-forward merge into (similarly to what happens in `git machete go down`).
          If `--yes` is specified, then `advance` fails.

        As an example, if `git machete status --color=never --list-commits` is as follows:

        then running `git machete advance` will fast-forward the current branch `develop` to match `feature/add-from-remote`, and subsequently slide out the latter.
        After `advance` completes, `status` will show:
        <dim>

        Discovers and displays tree of branch dependencies using a heuristic based on reflogs and asks whether to overwrite the existing definition file with the new discovered tree.
        If confirmed with a `y[es]` or `e[dit]` reply, backs up the current definition file (if it exists) as `$GIT_DIR/machete~` and saves the new tree under the usual `$GIT_DIR/machete` path.
        If the reply was `e[dit]`, additionally an editor is opened (as in `git machete edit`) after saving the new definition file.

        Options:

    "edit": """
        <b>Usage: git machete e[dit]</b>

        Opens an editor and lets you edit the definition file manually.

        The editor is determined by checking up the following locations:
        * `$GIT_MACHETE_EDITOR`

        * `$(git config core.editor)`

        <b>Usage:
          git machete fork-point [--inferred] [<branch>]
          git machete fork-point --override-to=<revision>|--override-to-inferred|--override-to-parent [<branch>]
          git machete fork-point --unset-override [<branch>]</b>

        Note: in all three forms, if no <branch> is specified, the currently checked out branch is assumed.
        The branch in question does not need to occur in the definition file.


        Without any option, displays full SHA of the fork point commit for the <branch>.
        Fork point of the given <branch> is the commit at which the history of the <branch> diverges from history of any other branch.

        Fork point is assumed by many `git machete` commands as the place where the unique history of the <branch> starts.
        The range of commits between the fork point and the tip of the given branch is, for instance:
        * listed for each branch by `git machete status --list-commits`
        * passed to `git rebase` by `git machete reapply`/`slide-out`/`traverse`/`update`
        * provided to `git diff`/`log` by `git machete diff`/`log`.

        `git machete` assumes fork point of <branch> is the most recent commit in the log of <branch> that has NOT been introduced on that very branch,
        but instead occurs on a reflog (see help for `git reflog`) of some other, usually chronologically earlier, branch.
        This yields a correct result in typical cases, but there are some situations
        (esp. when some local branches have been deleted) where the fork point might not be determined correctly.
        Thus, all rebase-involving operations (`reapply`, `slide-out`, `traverse` and `update`) run `git rebase` in the interactive mode by default,
        unless told explicitly not to do so by `--no-interactive-rebase` flag, so that the suggested commit range can be inspected before the rebase commences.
        Also, `reapply`, `slide-out`, `squash`, and `update` allow to specify the fork point explicitly by a command-line option.

        `git machete fork-point` is different (and more powerful) than `git merge-base --fork-point`,
        since the latter takes into account only the reflog of the one provided upstream branch,
        while the former scans reflogs of all local branches and their remote tracking branches.
        This makes git-machete's `fork-point` more resilient to modifications of .git/machete file where certain branches are re-attached under new parents (upstreams).


        With `--override-to=<revision>`, sets up a fork point override for <branch>.
        Fork point for <branch> will be overridden to the provided <revision> (commit) as long as the <branch> still points to (or is descendant of) the commit X
        that <branch> pointed to at the moment the override is set up.
        Even if revision is a symbolic name (e.g. other branch name or `HEAD~3`) and not explicit commit hash (like `a1b2c3ff`),
        it's still resolved to a specific commit hash at the moment the override is set up (and not later when the override is actually used).
        The override data is stored under `machete.overrideForkPoint.<branch>.to` and `machete.overrideForkPoint.<branch>.whileDescendantOf` git config keys.
        Note: the provided fork point <revision> must be an ancestor of the current <branch> commit X.

        With `--override-to-parent`, overrides fork point of the <branch> to the commit currently pointed by <branch>'s parent in the branch dependency tree.
        Note: this will only work if <branch> has a parent at all (i.e. is not a root) and parent of <branch> is an ancestor of current <branch> commit X.

        With `--inferred`, displays the commit that `git machete fork-point` infers to be the fork point of <branch>.
        If there is NO fork point override for <branch>, this is identical to the output of `git machete fork-point`.
        If there is a fork point override for <branch>, this is identical to the what the output of `git machete fork-point` would be if the override was NOT present.

        With `--override-to-inferred` option, overrides fork point of the <branch> to the commit that `git machete fork-point` infers to be the fork point of <branch>.
        Note: this piece of information is also displayed by `git machete status --list-commits` in case a yellow edge occurs.

        With `--unset-override`, the fork point override for <branch> is unset.
        This is simply done by removing the corresponding `machete.overrideForkPoint.<branch>.*` config entries.


        <b>Note:</b> if an overridden fork point applies to a branch `B`, then it's considered to be <green>connected with a green edge</green> to its upstream (parent) `U`,
        even if the overridden fork point of `B` is NOT equal to the commit pointed by `U`.

        <b>Usage: git machete help [<command>]</b>

        Prints a summary of this tool, or a detailed info on a command if provided.
    """,
    "hooks": """
        As with the standard git hooks, git-machete looks for its own specific hooks in `$GIT_DIR/hooks/*` (or `$(git config core.hooksPath)/*`, if set).

        Note: `hooks` is not a command as such, just a help topic (there is no `git machete hooks` command).

        * <b>machete-post-slide-out <new-upstream> <lowest-slid-out-branch> [<new-downstreams>...]</b>
            The hook that is executed after a branch (or possibly multiple branches, in case of `slide-out`)
            is slid out by `advance`, `slide-out` or `traverse`.

            At least two parameters (branch names) are passed to the hook:
            * <b><new-upstream></b> is the upstream of the branch that has been slid out,
              or in case of multiple branches being slid out - the upstream of the highest slid out branch;
            * <b><lowest-slid-out-branch></b> is the branch that has been slid out,
              or in case of multiple branches being slid out - the lowest slid out branch;
            * <b><new-downstreams></b> are all the following (possibly zero) parameters,
              which correspond to all original downstreams of <lowest-slid-out-branch>, now reattached as the downstreams of <new-upstream>.
              Note that this may be zero, one, or multiple branches.

            Note: the hook, if present, is executed:
            * zero or once during a `advance` execution (depending on whether the slide-out has been confirmed or not),
            * exactly once during a `slide-out` execution (even if multiple branches are slid out),
            * zero or more times during `traverse` (every time a slide-out operation is confirmed).

            If the hook returns a non-zero exit code, then an error is raised and the execution of the command is aborted,
            i.e. `slide-out` won't attempt rebase of the new downstream branches and `traverse` won't continue the traversal.
            In case of `advance` there is no difference (other than exit code of the entire `advance` command being non-zero),
            since slide-out is the last operation that happens within `advance`.
            Note that non-zero exit code of the hook doesn't cancel the effects of slide-out itself, only the subsequent operations.
            The hook is executed only once the slide-out is complete and can in fact rely on .git/machete file being updated to the new branch layout.

        * <b>machete-pre-rebase <new-base> <fork-point-hash> <branch-being-rebased></b>
            The hook that is executed before rebase is run during `reapply`, `slide-out`, `traverse` and `update`.
            Note that it is NOT executed by `squash` (despite its similarity to `reapply`), since no rebase is involved in `squash`.

            The parameters are exactly the three revisions that are passed to `git rebase --onto`:
            1. what is going to be the new base for the rebased commits,
            2. what is the fork point - the place where the rebased history diverges from the upstream history,
            3. what branch is rebased.
            If the hook returns a non-zero exit code, an error is raised and the entire rebase is aborted.

            Note: this hook is independent from git's standard `pre-rebase` hook.
            If machete-pre-rebase returns zero, the execution flow continues to `git rebase`, which may also run `pre-rebase` hook if present.
            `machete-pre-rebase` is thus always launched before `pre-rebase`.

        * <b>machete-status-branch <branch-name></b>
            The hook that is executed for each branch displayed during `discover`, `status` and `traverse`.

            The standard output of this hook is displayed at the end of the line, after branch name, (optionally) custom annotation and (optionally) remote sync-ness status.
            Standard error is ignored. If the hook returns a non-zero exit code, both stdout and stderr are ignored, and printing the status continues as usual.

            Note: the hook is always invoked with `ASCII_ONLY` variable passed into the environment.
            If `status` runs in ASCII-only mode (i.e. if `--color=auto` and stdout is not a terminal, or if `--color=never`), then `ASCII_ONLY=true`, otherwise `ASCII_ONLY=false`.

        Please see hook_samples/ directory of git-machete project for examples.
        An example of using the standard git `post-commit` hook to `git machete add` branches automatically is also included.

        Removes the given branch (or multiple branches) from the branch tree definition. If no branch has been specified current branch is assumed as the only branch.
        Then synchronizes the downstream (child) branches of the last specified branch on the top of the upstream (parent) branch of the first specified branch.
        Sync is performed either by rebase (default) or by merge (if `--merge` option passed).

        The most common use is to slide out a single branch whose upstream was a `develop`/`master` branch and that has been recently merged.

        Since this tool is designed to perform only one single rebase/merge at the end, provided branches must form a chain, i.e. all of the following conditions must be met:
        * for i=1..N-1, (i+1)-th branch must be the only downstream (child) branch of the i-th branch,
        * all provided branches must have an upstream branch (so, in other words, roots of branch dependency tree cannot be slid out).

        For example, let's assume the following dependency tree:
        <dim>
          develop
              adjust-reads-prec
                  block-cancel-order
                      change-table
                          drop-location-type
                      add-notification
        </dim>
        And now let's assume that `adjust-reads-prec` and later `block-cancel-order` were merged to develop.
        After running `git machete slide-out adjust-reads-prec block-cancel-order` the tree will be reduced to:
        <dim>
          develop
              change-table
                  drop-location-type
              add-notification
        </dim>
        and `change-table` and `add-notification` will be rebased onto develop (fork point for this rebase is configurable, see `-d` option below).

        Note: This command doesn't delete any branches from git, just removes them from the tree of branch dependencies.

        Displays a tree-shaped status of the branches listed in the definition file.

        Apart from simply ASCII-formatting the definition file, this also:

        * colors the edges between upstream (parent) and downstream (children) branches:

          - <b><green>green edge</green></b> means that the downstream branch tip is a <b>direct descendant</b> of the upstream branch tip
            and the fork point of the downstream branch is <b>equal</b> to the upstream branch tip,

          - <b><dim>grey/dimmed edge</dim></b> means that the downstream branch has been <b>merged</b> to the upstream branch,
            detected by commit equivalency (default), or by strict detection of merge commits (if `--no-detect-squash-merges` passed).


        * prints `(untracked/ahead of <remote>/behind <remote>/diverged from [& older than] <remote>)` message if the branch is not in sync with its remote counterpart;

        * optionally lists commits introduced on each branch if `-l`/`--list-commits` or `-L`/`--list-commits-with-hashes` is supplied.

        The currently checked-out branch is underlined.

        In case of yellow edge, use `-l` flag to show the exact location of the inferred fork point
        (which indicates e.g. what range of commits is going to be rebased when the branch is updated).
        The inferred fork point can be always overridden manually, see help on `fork-point`.

        Grey/dimmed edge suggests that the downstream branch can be slid out (see help on `slide-out` and `traverse`).

        Using colors can be disabled with a `--color` flag set to `never`.
        With `--color=always`, git machete always emits colors and with `--color=auto`, it emits colors only when standard output is connected to a terminal.
        `--color=auto` is the default. When colors are disabled, relation between branches is represented in the following way:
        <dim>

        * otherwise, if the branch is not in "green" sync with its parent/upstream (see help for `status`):
          - asks the user whether to rebase (default) or merge (if `--merge` passed) the branch onto into its upstream branch - equivalent to `git machete update` with no `--fork-point` option passed;

        * if the branch is not tracked on a remote, is ahead of its remote counterpart, or diverged from the counterpart & has newer head commit than the counterpart:
          - asks the user whether to push the branch (possibly with `--force-with-lease` if the branches diverged);
        * otherwise, if the branch diverged from the remote counterpart & has older head commit than the counterpart:
          - asks the user whether to `git reset --keep` the branch to its remote counterpart
        * otherwise, if the branch is behind its remote counterpart:
          - asks the user whether to pull the branch;

        * and finally, if any of the above operations has been successfully completed:
          - prints the updated `status`.

        Note that even if the traverse flow is stopped (typically due to merge/rebase conflicts), running `git machete traverse` after the merge/rebase is finished will pick up the walk where it stopped.

          <b>--push-untracked</b>             Push untracked branches to remote - default behavior.

          <b>--return-to=WHERE</b>            Specifies the branch to return after traversal is successfully completed; WHERE can be `here` (the current branch at the moment when traversal starts),
                                       `nearest-remaining` (nearest remaining branch in case the `here` branch has been slid out by the traversal)
                                       or `stay` (the default - just stay wherever the traversal stops).
                                       Note: when user quits by `q/yq` or when traversal is stopped because one of git actions fails, the behavior is always `stay`.

          <b>-W</b>                           Equivalent to `--fetch --whole`; useful for even more automated traversal of all branches.

        <b>Usage: git machete update [-f|--fork-point=<fork-point-commit>] [-M|--merge] [-n|--no-edit-merge|--no-interactive-rebase]</b>

        Synchronizes the current branch with its upstream (parent) branch either by rebase (default) or by merge (if `--merge` option passed).

        If updating by rebase, interactively rebases the current branch on the top of its upstream (parent) branch.
        The chunk of the history to be rebased starts at the fork point of the current branch, which by default is inferred automatically, but can also be set explicitly by `--fork-point`.
        See `git machete help fork-point` for more details on meaning of the "fork point".

        If updating by merge, merges the upstream (parent) branch into the current branch.

        <b>Options:</b>
          <b>-f, --fork-point=<fork-point-commit></b>    If updating by rebase, specifies the alternative fork point commit after which the rebased part of history is meant to start.
                                                  Not allowed if updating by merge.

          <b>-M, --merge</b>                             Update by merge rather than by rebase.

          <b>-n</b>                                      If updating by rebase, equivalent to `--no-interactive-rebase`. If updating by merge, equivalent to `--no-edit-merge`.

          <b>--no-edit-merge</b>                         If updating by merge, skip opening the editor for merge commit message while doing `git merge` (i.e. pass `--no-edit` flag to underlying `git merge`).
                                                  Not allowed if updating by rebase.

          <b>--no-interactive-rebase</b>                 If updating by rebase, run `git rebase` in non-interactive mode (without `-i/--interactive` flag).
                                                  Not allowed if updating by merge.
