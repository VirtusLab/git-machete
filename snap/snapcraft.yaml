  git machete is a versatile tool for organizing your git repo, including features like:
  - Neat, customizable `git machete status` that shows what branches are in sync with their parent branch/remote tracking branch and which of them need to be rebased/merged/pulled/pushed
  - Semi-automatic `git machete traverse` through the branches that helps you effortlessly rebase/merge and push/pull the branches you care for
  - Automatic discovery of branch relations (`git machete discover`)
