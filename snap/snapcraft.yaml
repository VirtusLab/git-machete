  git machete is a versatile tool for organizing your git repo, including features like:
  - Neat, customizable `git machete status` that shows what branches are in sync with their parent branch/remote tracking branch and which of them need to be rebased/merged/pulled/pushed
  - Semi-automatic `git machete traverse` through the branches that helps you effortlessly rebase/merge and push/pull the branches you care for
  - Automatic discovery of branch relations (`git machete discover`)
# This software is unlikely to be used outside of desktop machines.
# Let's limit the number of target architectures to reduce the build times.
architectures:
  # See https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/how-can-i-publish-a-snap-that-can-provide-binaries-for-all-the-supported-architectures/8556/4
  # on why not just `build-on: [ amd64, i386 ]`.
  - build-on: amd64
  - build-on: i386
