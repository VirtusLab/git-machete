  # Note that there is no particular reason for the below assignment
  # of PEP8/docs checks to Python version, other than:
  #  - Python 3.6 being EOLed and hence not supporting the versions of packages used for the checks,
  #  - https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/issues/936 apparently forcing the use of Python 3.11 for Sphinx HTML docs.
  # Each of these checks needs to be run against just one Python version
  # (since there's very little chance that they pass under one version but fail under another),
  # so let's spread these checks evenly across versions to reduce CI execution time
  # (when compared to the scenario where all checks are executed under the same Python version).
