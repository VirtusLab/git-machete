    git machete file

Outputs the absolute path of branch layout file.
The file is always called ``machete`` and is located in the git directory of the project.

Three cases are possible:

* if ``git machete`` is executed from a regular working directory (not a worktree or submodule),
  the file is located under ``.git/machete``,
* if ``git machete`` is executed from a **worktree**,
  the file path depends on the ``machete.worktree.useTopLevelMacheteFile`` config key value:

  - if ``machete.worktree.useTopLevelMacheteFile`` is true (default), the file is located under ``.git/machete``
  - if ``machete.worktree.useTopLevelMacheteFile`` is false, the file is located under ``.git/worktrees/.../machete``,

* if ``git machete`` is executed from a **submodule**, this file is located in the git folder of the submodule itself under ``.git/modules/.../machete``.
