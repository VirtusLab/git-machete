gitlab
======
**Usage:**

.. code-block:: shell

    git machete gitlab <subcommand>

where ``<subcommand>`` is one of: ``anno-mrs``, ``checkout-mrs``, ``create-mr``, ``retarget-mr`` or ``restack-mr``.

Creates, checks out and manages GitLab MRs while keeping them reflected in branch layout file.

.. note::

    To allow GitLab API access for private projects (and also to perform side-effecting actions like opening a MR,
    even in case of public projects), a GitLab API token with ``api`` scope is required, see https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens.
    This will be resolved from the first of:

    #. ``GITLAB_TOKEN`` env var,
    #. content of the ``.gitlab-token`` file in the home directory (``~``),
    #. current auth token from the ``glab`` GitLab CLI.

    Self-managed GitLab domains are supported.

    ``GITLAB_TOKEN`` is used indiscriminately for any domain, both for gitlab.com and a self-managed instance.

    ``glab`` has its own built-in support for non-gitlab.com domains, which is honored by git-machete.

    ``.gitlab-token`` can have multiple per-domain entries in the format:

    .. code-block::

      glpat-mytoken_for_gitlab_com
      glpat-myothertoken_for_git_example_org git.example.org
      glpat-yetanothertoken_for_git_example_com git.example.com

.. note::
  See **Git config keys** below in case the target project cannot be detected automatically (for example, in case of GitLab self-managed instance).

**Subcommands:**

``anno-mrs [--with-urls]``:
    Annotates the branches based on their corresponding GitLab MR numbers and authors.
    Any existing annotations are overwritten for the branches that have an opened MR; annotations for the other branches remain untouched.
    Equivalent to ``git machete anno --sync-gitlab-mrs``.

    When the current user is NOT the author of the MR associated with that branch, adds ``rebase=no push=no`` branch qualifiers used by ``git machete traverse``,
    so that you don't rebase or push someone else's MR by accident (see help for :ref:`traverse`).

    **Options:**

    --with-urls                   Also include full MR URLs in the annotations (rather than just MR number).


``checkout-mrs [--all | --by=<gitlab-login> | --mine | <MR-number-1> ... <MR-number-N>]``:
    Check out the source branch of the given merge requests (specified by numbers or by a flag),
    also traverse chain of merge requests upwards, adding branches one by one to git-machete and check them out locally.
    Once the specified merge requests are checked out locally, annotate local branches with corresponding merge request numbers.
    If only one MR has been checked out, then switch the local repository's HEAD to its source branch.

    When the current user is NOT the author of the MR associated with that branch, adds ``rebase=no push=no`` branch qualifiers used by ``git machete traverse``,
    so that you don't rebase or push someone else's MR by accident (see help for :ref:`traverse`).

    **Options:**

    --all                   Checkout all open MRs.

    --by=<gitlab-login>     Checkout open MRs authored by the given GitLab user, where ``<gitlab-login>`` is the GitLab account name.

    --mine                  Checkout open MRs for the current user associated with the GitLab token.

    **Parameters:**

    ``<MR-number-1> ... <MR-number-N>``    Merge request numbers to checkout.

``create-mr [--draft] [--title=<title>] [--yes]``:
    Creates a MR for the current branch, using the upstream (parent) branch as the MR source branch.
    Once the MR is successfully created, annotates the current branch with the new MR's number.

    If ``.git/info/milestone`` file is present, its contents (a single number --- milestone id) are used as milestone.
    Note that you need to use a global (not per-project) milestone id. Look for something like ``Milestone ID: 4489529`` on milestone web page.

    If ``.git/info/reviewers`` file is present, its contents (one GitLab login per line) are used to set reviewers.

    The MR title is determined in the following order of priority:
    1. If the `--title` option is provided, its value is used as the MR title.
    2. If the `.git/info/title` file is present, its contents (a single line) are used as the MR title.
    3. If neither the `--title` option is provided nor the `.git/info/title` file is present, the MR title defaults to the subject of the first unique commit on the branch.

    If ``.git/info/description`` or ``.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md`` template is present, its contents are used as MR description.
    Otherwise (or if ``machete.gitlab.forceDescriptionFromCommitMessage`` is set), MR description is taken from message body of the first unique commit of the branch.

    If the newly-created MR is stacked atop another MR, the actual MR description posted to GitLab will include a generated section ("intro")
    listing the entire related chain of MRs. This section will be delimited with ``<!-- start git-machete generated -->``
    and ``<!-- end git-machete generated -->`` comments in Markdown. If an MR template file exists and contains these comments already,
    the generated section will be placed between them; otherwise, it will be placed at the beginning.

    **Options:**

    --draft            Create the new MR as a draft.

    --title=<title>    Set the MR title explicitly (the default is to use the first included commit's message as the title).

    --yes              Do not ask for confirmation whether to push the branch.

``restack-mr``:
    Perform the following sequence of actions:

    #. If the MR for the current branch is ready for review, it gets converted to a draft.
    #. The MR is retargeted to its upstream (parent) branch, as in ``retarget-mr``.
    #. The branch is (force-)pushed into remote.
    #. If the MR has been converted to draft in step 1, it's reverted to ready for review state.

    The drafting/undrafting is useful in case the GitLab project has set up `code owners <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/>`_.
    Draft MRs don't get code owners automatically added as reviewers.

``retarget-mr [-b|--branch=<branch>] [--ignore-if-missing]``:
    Sets the target of the current (or specified) branch's MR to upstream (parent) branch, as seen by git machete (see ``git machete show up``).

    If after changing the base the MR ends up stacked atop another MR, the MR description posted to GitLab will include
    a generated section ("intro") listing the entire related chain of MRs.

    This intro will be updated or removed accordingly with the subsequent runs of ``retarget-mr``, even if the target branch is already up to date.

    **Options:**

    -b, --branch=<branch>     Specify the branch for which the associated MR source branch will be set to its upstream (parent) branch. The current branch is used if the option is absent.

    --ignore-if-missing       Ignore errors and quietly terminate execution if there is no MR opened for current (or specified) branch.
