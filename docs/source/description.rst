Description
=======================================

git machete is a robust tool that **simplifies your git workflows**.

The bird's eye view provided by git machete makes **merges/rebases/push/pulls hassle-free**
even when **multiple branches** are present in the repository
(master/develop, your topic branches, teammate's branches checked out for review, etc.).

Using this tool, you can maintain **small, focused, easy-to-review pull requests** with little effort.

A look at a ``git machete status`` gives an instant answer to the questions:

    * What branches are in this repository?
    * What is going to be merged (rebased/pushed/pulled) and to what?

``git machete traverse`` semi-automatically traverses the branches, helping you effortlessly rebase, merge, push and pull.
