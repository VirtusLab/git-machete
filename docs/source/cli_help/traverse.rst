    git machete t[raverse] [-F|--fetch] [-l|--list-commits] [-M|--merge]
                           [-n|--no-edit-merge|--no-interactive-rebase] [--no-detect-squash-merges]
                           [--[no-]push] [--[no-]push-untracked]
                           [--return-to=WHERE] [--start-from=WHERE] [-w|--whole] [-W] [-y|--yes]

Traverses the branch dependency tree in pre-order (i.e. simply in the order as they occur in the definition file).
By default traverse starts from current branch, however this behaviour can be customized using options: ``--start-from=``, ``--whole`` or ``-w``, ``-W``.
For each branch, the command:

    * detects if the branch is merged to its parent/upstream:

      - by commit equivalency (default), or by strict detection of merge commits (if ``--no-detect-squash-merges`` passed),
      - if so, asks the user whether to slide out the branch from the dependency tree (typically branches are longer needed after they're merged);

    * otherwise, if the branch is not in :green:`green` sync with its parent/upstream (see :ref:`status`):

      - asks the user whether to rebase (default) or merge (if ``--merge`` passed) the branch onto into its upstream branch --- equivalent to ``git machete update`` with no ``--fork-point`` option passed;

    * if the branch is not tracked on a remote, is ahead of its remote counterpart, or diverged from the counterpart & has newer head commit than the counterpart:

      - asks the user whether to push the branch (possibly with ``--force-with-lease`` if the branches diverged);

    * otherwise, if the branch diverged from the remote counterpart & has older head commit than the counterpart:

      - asks the user whether to ``git reset --keep`` the branch to its remote counterpart

    * otherwise, if the branch is behind its remote counterpart:

      - asks the user whether to pull the branch;

    * and finally, if any of the above operations has been successfully completed:

      - prints the updated ``status``.

Note that even if the traverse flow is stopped (typically due to merge/rebase conflicts), running ``git machete traverse`` after the merge/rebase is finished will pick up the walk where it stopped.
In other words, there is no need to explicitly ask to `continue` as it is the case with e.g. ``git rebase``.

**Options:**

-F, --fetch                  Fetch the remotes of all managed branches at the beginning of traversal (no ``git pull`` involved, only ``git fetch``).

-l, --list-commits           When printing the status, additionally list the messages of commits introduced on each branch.

-M, --merge                  Update by merge rather than by rebase.

-n                           If updating by rebase, equivalent to ``--no-interactive-rebase``. If updating by merge, equivalent to ``--no-edit-merge``.

--no-detect-squash-merges    Only consider `strict` (fast-forward or 2-parent) merges, rather than rebase/squash merges, when detecting if a branch is merged into its upstream (parent).

--no-edit-merge              If updating by merge, skip opening the editor for merge commit message while doing ``git merge`` (i.e. pass ``--no-edit flag`` to underlying ``git merge``). Not allowed if updating by rebase.

--no-interactive-rebase      If updating by rebase, run ``git rebase`` in non-interactive mode (without ``-i/--interactive`` flag). Not allowed if updating by merge.

--no-push                    Do not push any (neither tracked nor untracked) branches to remote, re-enable via ``--push``.

--no-push-untracked          Do not push untracked branches to remote, re-enable via ``--push-untracked``.

--push                       Push all (both tracked and untracked) branches to remote --- default behavior.

--push-untracked             Push untracked branches to remote --- default behavior.

--return-to=WHERE            Specifies the branch to return after traversal is successfully completed; WHERE can be ``here`` (the current branch at the moment when traversal starts), ``nearest-remaining`` (nearest remaining branch in case the ``here`` branch has been slid out by the traversal) or ``stay`` (the default --- just stay wherever the traversal stops). Note: when user quits by ``q``/``yq`` or when traversal is stopped because one of git actions fails, the behavior is always ``stay``.

--start-from=WHERE           Specifies the branch to start the traversal from; WHERE can be ``here`` (the default --- current branch, must be managed by git machete), ``root`` (root branch of the current branch, as in ``git machete show root``) or ``first-root`` (first listed managed branch).

-w, --whole                  Equivalent to ``-n --start-from=first-root`` --return-to=nearest-remaining; useful for quickly traversing & syncing all branches (rather than doing more fine-grained operations on the local section of the branch tree).

-W                           Equivalent to ``--fetch --whole``; useful for even more automated traversal of all branches.

-y, --yes                    Don't ask for any interactive input, including confirmation of rebase/push/pull. Implies ``-n``.

**Environment variables:**

``GIT_MACHETE_REBASE_OPTS``
    Extra options to pass to the underlying ``git rebase`` invocations, space-separated.

    Example: ``GIT_MACHETE_REBASE_OPTS="--keep-empty --rebase-merges" git machete traverse``.
