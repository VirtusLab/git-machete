**Usage:**

.. code-block:: shell

    git machete github <subcommand>

where ``<subcommand>`` is one of: ``anno-prs``, ``checkout-prs``, ``create-pr``, ``retarget-pr``.

Creates, checks out and manages GitHub PRs while keeping them reflected in branch definition file.

.. include:: github_api_access.rst
.. include:: github_config_keys.rst

**Subcommands:**

``anno-prs``:
    Annotates the branches based on their corresponding GitHub PR numbers and authors.
    Any existing annotations are overwritten for the branches that have an opened PR; annotations for the other branches remain untouched.
    Equivalent to ``git machete anno --sync-github-prs``.
    When the current user is **not** the owner of the PR associated with that branch, adds ``rebase=no push=no`` branch qualifiers used by ``git machete traverse``,
    so that you don't rebase or push someone else's PR by accident (see help for :ref:`traverse`).


``checkout-prs [--all | --by=<github-login> | --mine | <PR-number-1> ... <PR-number-N>]``:
    Check out the head branch of the given pull requests (specified by numbers or by a flag),
    also traverse chain of pull requests upwards, adding branches one by one to git-machete and check them out locally.
    Once the specified pull requests are checked out locally, annotate local branches with corresponding pull request numbers.
    If only one PR has been checked out, then switch the local repository's HEAD to its head branch.
    When the current user is **not** the owner of the PR associated with that branch, adds ``rebase=no push=no`` branch qualifiers used by ``git machete traverse``,
    so that you don't rebase or push someone else's PR by accident (see help for :ref:`traverse`).

    **Options:**

    --all                   Checkout all open PRs.

    --by=<github-login>     Checkout open PRs authored by the given GitHub user, where ``<github-login>`` is the GitHub account name.

    --mine                  Checkout open PRs for the current user associated with the GitHub token.

    **Parameters:**

    ``<PR-number-1> ... <PR-number-N>``    Pull request numbers to checkout.

``create-pr [--draft]``:
    Creates a PR for the current branch, using the upstream (parent) branch as the PR base.
    Once the PR is successfully created, annotates the current branch with the new PR's number.

    If ``.git/info/description`` file is present, its contents are used as PR description.
    If ``.git/info/milestone`` file is present, its contents (a single number --- milestone id) are used as milestone.
    If ``.git/info/reviewers`` file is present, its contents (one GitHub login per line) are used to set reviewers.

    **Options:**

    --draft    Creates the new PR as a draft.

``retarget-pr [-b|--branch=<branch>]``:
    Sets the base of the current (or specified) branch's PR to upstream (parent) branch, as seen by git machete (see ``git machete show up``).

    **Options:**

    -b, --branch=<branch>     Specify the branch for which the associated PR base will be set to its upstream (parent) branch. The current branch is used if the option is absent.

``sync``:
    Synchronizes with the remote repository:

      1. checks out open PRs for the current user associated with the GitHub token and also traverses the chain of pull requests upwards,
         adding branches one by one to git-machete and checks them out locally as well,
      2. deletes unmanaged branches,
      3. deletes untracked managed branches that have no downstream branch.

    Equivalent of ``git machete clean --checkout-my-github-prs``.

**Environment variables (all subcommands):**

``GITHUB_TOKEN``
    GitHub API token.
