To make it easier to select branch name from the ``status`` output on certain terminals
(like `Alacritty <https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty>`_), you can add an extra space between └─ and branch name
by setting ``git config machete.status.extraSpaceBeforeBranchName true``.

For example, by default the status is displayed as:

.. code-block::

    develop
    │
    ├─feature_branch1
    │
    └─feature_branch2

With ``machete.status.extraSpaceBeforeBranchName`` config set to ``true``:

.. code-block::

     develop
     │
     ├─ feature_branch1
     │
     └─ feature_branch2

..
    Text order in this file is relevant, if you want to change something, find each occurrence of ``.. include:: git-config-keys/status_extraSpaceBeforeBranchName.rst``
    and if this occurrence has ``start-line`` or ``end-line`` options provided, make sure that after changes the output text stays the same.
