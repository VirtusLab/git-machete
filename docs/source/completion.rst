  Installing git machete command line completion
  ==============================================

  Bash:

      * Mac (via Homebrew)
          Make sure you have bash completion installed (with ``brew install bash-completion``).

          ``brew install git machete`` automatically installs bash completion files for ``git machete``.
      * Linux
          #. In a non-minimal installation of Linux, bash completion should be available.
          #. Place the completion script in ``/etc/bash_completion.d/``.

          .. code-block:: shell

              sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/master/completion/git-machete.completion.bash -o /etc/bash_completion.d/git-machete

  Zsh:

      * Linux/Mac: with `oh-my-zsh <https://ohmyz.sh/>`_ shell
          .. code-block:: shell

              $ mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/git-machete/
              $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/master/completion/git-machete.completion.zsh -o ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/git-machete/git-machete.plugin.zsh

          Add ``git machete`` to the plugins list in ``~/.zshrc`` to run autocompletion within the oh-my-zsh shell.
          In the following example, ``...`` represents other zsh plugins you may have installed.

          .. code-block:: shell

              plugins=(... git-machete
              )


          * Workarounds for Zsh on Mac

              On Mac, unfortunately there might be a problem that ``git machete`` subcommands still don't complete even when the zsh plugin is active. This issue also affects other non-standard ``git`` subcommands like ``git flow`` and ``git lfs``. To work the issue around, first establish how ``git`` is installed in your system.

              .. code-block:: shell

                  which git


              If ``git`` resolves to ``/usr/bin/git``, then likely ``git`` is the default installation provided in Mac OS.
              As a workaround, add the following line directly at the end of ``~/.zshrc``:

              .. code-block:: shell

                  source ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/git-machete/git-machete.plugin.zsh

              and reload the shell.

              If ``git`` resolves to ``/usr/local/bin/git``, then likely ``git`` has been installed via ``brew``.
              Up to our current knowledge, workaround is much harder to provide in such scenario.

              One option is to ``brew uninstall git`` and then use the solution for Mac's default ``git`` provided above,
              but that's likely undesired since ``git`` shipped with Mac OS is almost always an older version than what's available via ``brew``.

              Another, less intrusive workaround is to make sure that the zsh ``_git`` function
              is NOT taken from brew-git's ``/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_git``,
              but instead from ``/usr/share/zsh/5.7.1/functions/_git`` (zsh version path fragment can be different from ``5.7.1``).
              Add the following at the end of ``~/.zshrc``:

              .. code-block:: shell

                  source /usr/share/zsh/5.7.1/functions/_git  # or other zsh version instead of 5.7.1, depending on what's available in the system

              and reload the shell.

      * Linux/Mac: without oh-my-zsh shell
          #. Place the completion script in your ``/path/to/zsh/completion`` (typically ``~/.zsh/completion/``):

              .. code-block:: shell

                  $ mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
                  $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/master/completion/git-machete.completion.zsh -o ~/.zsh/completion/_git-machete

          #. Include the directory in your ``$fpath`` by adding in ``~/.zshrc``:

              .. code-block:: shell

                  fpath=(~/.zsh/completion $fpath)

          #. Make sure ``compinit`` is loaded or do it by adding in ``~/.zshrc``:

              .. code-block:: shell

                  autoload -Uz compinit && compinit -i

          #. Then reload your shell:

              .. code-block:: shell

                  exec $SHELL -l

  Fish:

      * Mac (via Homebrew)
          Please take a look at the section about `installation via Homebrew <https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete#using-homebrew-macos>`_.
          ``brew install git-machete`` automatically installs fish completion files for ``git machete``.
      * Linux
          Place the completion script in ``/path/to/fish/completions/`` (typically ``~/.config/fish/completions/git-machete.fish``).

          .. code-block:: shell

              mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
              curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/master/completion/git-machete.fish -o ~/.config/fish/completions/git-machete.fish
              echo "source ~/.config/fish/completions/git-machete.fish >/dev/null" >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
