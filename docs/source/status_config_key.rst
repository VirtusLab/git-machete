.. note::

    To make it easier to select branch name from the ``status`` output on certain terminals
    (e.g. `Alacritty <https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty>`_), you can add an extra space between └─ and ``branch name``
    by setting ``git config machete.status.extraSpaceBeforeBranchName true``.

    For example, by default the status is displayed as:

    .. code-block::

      develop
      │
      ├─feature_branch1
      │
      └─feature_branch2

    With ``machete.status.extraSpaceBeforeBranchName`` config set to ``true``:

    .. code-block::

       develop
       │
       ├─ feature_branch1
       │
       └─ feature_branch2

..
    Text order in this file is relevant, if you want to change something, find each ``.. include:: status_config_key.rst`` instance
    and if the instance has ``start-line`` or ``end-line`` options provided, make sure that after changes the output text stays the same.
