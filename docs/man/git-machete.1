.SH NAME
git-machete \- git-machete 3.26.2
.sp
git machete is a robust tool that \fBsimplifies your git workflows\fP\&.
.sp
The bird\(aqs eye view provided by git machete makes \fBmerges/rebases/push/pulls hassle\-free\fP
even when \fBmultiple branches\fP are present in the repository
(master/develop, your topic branches, teammate\(aqs branches checked out for review, etc.).
.sp
Using this tool, you can maintain \fBsmall, focused, easy\-to\-review pull requests\fP with little effort.
.sp
A look at a \fBgit machete status\fP gives an instant answer to the questions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
What branches are in this repository?
.IP \(bu 2
What is going to be merged (rebased/pushed/pulled) and to what?
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBgit machete traverse\fP semi\-automatically traverses the branches, helping you effortlessly rebase, merge, push and pull.
.sp
When git\-machete is installed, it adds \fBmachete\fP command to \fBgit\fP, so it can be called from command line: \fBgit machete <command> <options>\fP\&.
git machete comes with a wide variety of customizable commands and in this site you can find their documentation.

.sp
Adds the provided <branch> (or the current branch, if none specified) to the branch layout file.
If <branch> is provided but no local branch with the given name exists:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
if a remote branch of the same name exists in exactly one remote,
then user is asked whether to check out this branch locally (as in \fBgit checkout\fP),
.IP \(bu 2
otherwise, user is asked whether it should be created as a new local branch.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the branch layout file is empty or \fB\-R/\-\-as\-root\fP is provided, the branch will be added as a root of the tree of branch dependencies.
Otherwise, the desired upstream (parent) branch can be specified with \fB\-o/\-\-onto\fP\&.
Neither of these options is mandatory, however; if both are skipped, git machete will try to automatically infer the target upstream.
If the upstream branch can be inferred, the user will be presented with inferred branch and asked to confirm.
.sp
Note: all the effects of \fBadd\fP (except git branch creation) can as well be achieved by manually editing the branch layout file.

.sp
Fast forwards (as in \fBgit merge \-\-ff\-only\fP) the current branch \fBC\fP to match its downstream \fBD\fP, pushes \fBC\fP
and subsequently slides out \fBD\fP\&. All three steps require manual confirmation unless \fB\-y/\-\-yes\fP is provided.
.sp
The downstream \fBD\fP is selected according to the following criteria:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
if \fBC\fP has exactly one downstream (child) branch \fBd\fP connected with a green edge (see help for \fI\%status\fP) to \fBC\fP
or is overridden, then \fBd\fP is selected as \fBD\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
if \fBC\fP has no downstream branches connected with a green edge to \fBC\fP, then \fBadvance\fP fails,
.IP \(bu 2
if \fBC\fP has more than one downstream branch connected with a green edge to \fBC\fP,
then user is asked to pick the branch to fast\-forward merge into (similarly to what happens in \fBgit machete go down\fP).
If \fB\-\-yes\fP is specified, then \fBadvance\fP fails.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an example, if \fBgit machete status \-\-color=never \-\-list\-commits\fP is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then running \fBgit machete advance\fP will fast\-forward the current branch \fBdevelop\fP to match \fBfeature/add\-from\-remote\fP,
and subsequently slide out the latter.
After \fBadvance\fP completes, \fBstatus\fP will show:

Note that the current branch after the operation is still \fBdevelop\fP, just pointing to \fBfeature/add\-from\-remote\fP\(aqs tip now.
.sp
If the current branch \fBC\fP is annotated with \fBpush=no\fP qualifier, the push is not performed.
If the downstream branch \fBD\fP is annotated with \fBslide\-out=no\fP qualifier, the slide\-out is not performed.
See help for \fI\%traverse\fP for more details on the qualifiers.
.sp
\fBOptions:\fP

.sp
If invoked with \fB\-H\fP/\fB\-\-sync\-github\-prs\fP (for GitHub) or \fB\-L\fP/\fB\-\-sync\-gitlab\-mrs\fP (for GitLab),
annotates the branches based on their corresponding GitHub PR/GitLab MR numbers and authors.
When the current user is NOT the author of the PR/MR associated with that branch, adds \fBrebase=no push=no\fP branch qualifiers used by \fBgit machete traverse\fP,
so that you don\(aqt rebase or push someone else\(aqs PR/MR by accident (see help for \fI\%traverse\fP).
Any existing annotations (except branch qualifiers) are overwritten for the branches that have an opened PR/MR;
annotations for the other branches remain untouched.

For example, in a typical usage of GitHub Enterprise, it should be enough to just set \fBmachete.github.domain\fP\&.
Only \fBmachete.github.organization\fP and \fBmachete.github.repository\fP must be specified together.
.TP
.B \fBmachete.github.annotateWithUrls\fP:
Setting this config key to \fBtrue\fP will cause all commands that write GitHub PR numbers into annotations
to not only include PR number and author (if different from the current user), but also the full URL of the PR.
.sp
The affected (sub)commands clearly include \fBanno \-\-sync\-github\-prs\fP and \fBgithub anno\-prs\fP,
but also \fBgithub checkout\-prs\fP, \fBgithub create\-pr\fP, \fBgithub retarget\-pr\fP and \fBgithub restack\-pr\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBmachete.github.forceDescriptionFromCommitMessage\fP:
Setting this config key to \fBtrue\fP will force \fBgit machete github create\-pr\fP to take PR description
from the message body of the first unique commit of the branch, even if \fB\&.git/info/description\fP and/or \fB\&.github/pull_request_template.md\fP is present.

Note that you do \fBnot\fP need to set all four keys at once.
For example, in a typical usage for GitLab self\-managed instance, it should be enough to just set \fBmachete.gitlab.domain\fP\&.
Only \fBmachete.gitlab.namespace\fP and \fBmachete.gitlab.project\fP must be specified together.
.TP
.B \fBmachete.gitlab.annotateWithUrls\fP:
Setting this config key to \fBtrue\fP will cause all commands that write GitLab MR numbers into annotations
to not only include MR number and author (if different from the current user), but also the full URL of the MR.
.sp
The affected (sub)commands clearly include \fBanno \-\-sync\-gitlab\-mrs\fP and \fBgitlab anno\-mrs\fP,
but also \fBgitlab checkout\-mrs\fP, \fBgitlab create\-mr\fP, \fBgitlab retarget\-mr\fP and \fBgitlab restack\-mr\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBmachete.gitlab.forceDescriptionFromCommitMessage\fP:
Setting this config key to \fBtrue\fP will force \fBgit machete gitlab create\-mr\fP to take MR description
from the message body of the first unique commit of the branch, even if \fB\&.git/info/description\fP and/or \fB\&.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md\fP is present.
.TP
.B \fBmachete.overrideForkPoint.<branch>.to\fP:
Executing \fBgit machete fork\-point \-\-override\-to[\-parent|\-inferred|=<revision>] [<branch>]\fP sets up a fork point override for \fB<branch>\fP\&.
.sp
The override data is stored under \fBmachete.overrideForkPoint.<branch>.to\fP git config key.
.sp
There should be \fBno\fP need for the user to interact with this key directly,
\fBgit machete fork\-point\fP with flags should be used instead.
.TP
.B \fBmachete.squashMergeDetection\fP:
Controls the algorithm used to detect squash merges. Possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP: Fastest mode, with no squash merge/rebase detection. Only \fIstrict\fP (fast\-forward or 2\-parent) merges are detected.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsimple\fP (default): Compares the tree (files & directories in the commit) of the downstream branch with the trees of the upstream branch.
This detects squash merges/rebases as long as there exists a squash/rebase commit in the upstream that has the identical tree to what\(aqs in the downstream branch.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBexact\fP: Compares the patch (diff introduced by the commits) of the downstream branch with the patches of the upstream branch.
This detects squash merges in more cases than \fBsimple\fP mode.
However, it might have a significant performance impact on large repositories as it requires computing patches for commits in the upstream branch.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This has an impact on:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
whether a grey edge is displayed in \fBstatus\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
whether \fBtraverse\fP suggests to slide out the branch.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBmachete.status.extraSpaceBeforeBranchName\fP:
To make it easier to select branch name from the \fBstatus\fP output on certain terminals
(like \fI\%Alacritty\fP), you can add an extra space between └─ and \fBbranch name\fP
by setting \fBgit config machete.status.extraSpaceBeforeBranchName true\fP\&.
.sp
For example, by default the status is displayed as:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.B \fBmachete.traverse.push\fP:
To change the behavior of \fBgit machete traverse\fP command so that it doesn\(aqt push branches by default,
you need to set config key \fBgit config machete.traverse.push false\fP\&.
.sp
Configuration key value can be overridden by the presence of the \fB\-\-push\fP or \fB\-\-push\-untracked\fP flags.
.TP
.B \fBmachete.worktree.useTopLevelMacheteFile\fP:
The default value of this key is \fBtrue\fP, which means that the path to branch layout file will be \fB\&.git/machete\fP
for both regular directory and worktree.
.sp
If you want the worktree to have its own branch layout file (located under \fB\&.git/worktrees/.../machete\fP),

Without any option, \fBgit machete fork\-point\fP displays full hash of the fork point commit for the \fB<branch>\fP\&.
Fork point of the given \fB<branch>\fP is the commit at which the history of the \fB<branch>\fP diverges from history of any other branch.
.sp
Fork point is assumed by many \fBgit machete\fP commands as the place where the unique history of the \fB<branch>\fP starts.
The range of commits between the fork point and the tip of the given branch is, for instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBgit machete\fP assumes fork point of \fB<branch>\fP is the most recent commit in the log of \fB<branch>\fP that has NOT been introduced on that very branch,
but instead occurs on a reflog (see help for \fBgit reflog\fP) of some other branch.
This yields a correct result in typical cases, but there are some situations
(esp. when some local branches have been deleted) where the fork point might not be determined correctly.
Thus, all rebase\-involving operations (\fBreapply\fP, \fBslide\-out\fP, \fBtraverse\fP and \fBupdate\fP) run \fBgit rebase\fP in the interactive mode by default,
unless told explicitly not to do so by \fB\-\-no\-interactive\-rebase\fP flag. This way, the suggested commit range can be inspected before the rebase starts.
Also, \fBreapply\fP, \fBslide\-out\fP, \fBsquash\fP, and \fBupdate\fP allow to specify the fork point explicitly by a command\-line option.
.sp
\fBgit machete fork\-point\fP is different (and more powerful) than \fBgit merge\-base \-\-fork\-point\fP,
since the latter takes into account only the reflog of the one provided upstream branch,
while the former scans reflogs of all local branches and their remote tracking branches.
This makes git machete\(aqs \fBfork\-point\fP more resilient to modifications of \fB\&.git/machete\fP \fI\%file\fP when certain branches are re\-attached under new parents (upstreams).
.sp
With \fB\-\-override\-to=<revision>\fP, sets up a fork point override for \fB<branch>\fP\&.
Fork point for \fB<branch>\fP will be overridden to the provided <revision> (commit) as long as the \fB<branch>\fP still points to (or is descendant of) that commit.
The override data is stored under \fBmachete.overrideForkPoint.<branch>.to\fP git config key.
Note: the provided fork point \fB<revision>\fP must be an ancestor of the current \fB<branch>\fP commit.
.sp
With \fB\-\-override\-to\-parent\fP, overrides fork point of the \fB<branch>\fP to the commit currently pointed by \fB<branch>\fP\(aqs parent in the branch dependency tree.
Note: this will only work if \fB<branch>\fP has a parent at all (is not a root branch) and parent of \fB<branch>\fP is an ancestor of current \fB<branch>\fP commit.
.sp
With \fB\-\-inferred\fP, displays the commit that \fBgit machete fork\-point\fP infers to be the fork point of \fB<branch>\fP\&.
If there is NO fork point override for \fB<branch>\fP, this is identical to the output of \fBgit machete fork\-point\fP\&.
If there is a fork point override for \fB<branch>\fP, this is identical to the what the output of \fBgit machete fork\-point\fP would be if the override was NOT present.
.sp
With \fB\-\-override\-to\-inferred\fP option, overrides fork point of the \fB<branch>\fP to the commit that \fBgit machete fork\-point\fP infers to be the fork point of \fB<branch>\fP\&.
Note: this piece of information is also displayed by \fBgit machete status \-\-list\-commits\fP in case a yellow edge occurs.
.sp
With \fB\-\-unset\-override\fP, the fork point override for \fB<branch>\fP is unset.
This is simply done by removing the corresponding \fBmachete.overrideForkPoint.<branch>.to\fP config entry.
.sp
Note: if an overridden fork point applies to a branch \fBB\fP, then it\(aqs considered to be connected with a green edge to its upstream (parent) \fBU\fP,
even if the overridden fork point of \fBB\fP is NOT equal to the commit pointed by \fBU\fP\&.
.SH FORMAT
.sp
Note: there is no \fBgit machete format\fP command as such; \fBformat\fP is just a topic of \fBgit machete help\fP\&.
.sp
The format of the branch layout file should be as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
develop
    adjust\-reads\-prec PR #234 rebase=no push=no
        block\-cancel\-order PR #235 rebase=no

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above example \fBdevelop\fP and \fBmaster\fP are roots of the tree of branch dependencies.
Branches \fBadjust\-reads\-prec\fP, \fBedit\-margin\-not\-allowed\fP and \fBgrep\-errors\-script\fP are direct downstream branches for \fBdevelop\fP\&.
\fBblock\-cancel\-order\fP is a downstream branch of \fBadjust\-reads\-prec\fP, \fBchange\-table\fP is a downstream branch of \fBblock\-cancel\-order\fP and so on.
.sp
Every branch name can be followed (after a single space as a delimiter) by a custom annotation, for example \fBPR #234 rebase=no push=no\fP, \fBPR #235 rebase=no\fP or \fBpush=no\fP\&.
These annotations might contain branch qualifiers (\fBpush=no\fP, \fBrebase=no\fP, \fBslide\-out=no\fP) that control the behavior of \fBtraverse\fP (see help for \fI\%traverse\fP).
Also see help for \fI\%anno\fP command.

Tabs or any number of spaces can be used as indentation.
It\(aqs only important to use indentation characters consistently between all lines.

.SH HOOKS
.sp
As with the standard git hooks, git machete looks for its own specific hooks in \fB$GIT_DIR/hooks/*\fP (or \fB$(git config core.hooksPath)/*\fP, if set).
All hooks are executed from the top\-level folder of the repository (or top\-level folder of worktree/submodule, if applicable).
.sp
Note: \fBhooks\fP is not a command as such, just a help topic (there is no \fBgit machete hooks\fP command).
.sp
\fBHooks:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBmachete\-post\-slide\-out <new\-upstream> <lowest\-slid\-out\-branch> [<new\-downstreams>...]\fP
The hook that is executed after a branch (or possibly multiple branches, in case of \fBslide\-out\fP)
is slid out by \fBadvance\fP, \fBslide\-out\fP or \fBtraverse\fP\&.
.sp
At least two parameters (branch names) are passed to the hook:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
<new\-upstream> is the upstream of the branch that has been slid out, or in case of multiple branches being slid out
\-\-\- the upstream of the highest slid out branch;
.IP \(bu 2
<lowest\-slid\-out\-branch> is the branch that has been slid out, or in case of multiple branches being slid out \-\-\- the lowest slid out branch;
.IP \(bu 2
<new\-downstreams> are all the following (possibly zero) parameters, which correspond to all original downstreams
of <lowest\-slid\-out\-branch>, now reattached as the downstreams of <new\-upstream>.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that this may be zero, one, or multiple branches.
.sp
Note: the hook, if present, is executed:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
zero or once during a \fBadvance\fP execution (depending on whether the slide\-out has been confirmed or not),
.IP \(bu 2
exactly once during a \fBslide\-out\fP execution (even if multiple branches are slid out),
.IP \(bu 2
zero or more times during \fBtraverse\fP (every time a slide\-out operation is confirmed).
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the hook returns a non\-zero exit code, then an error is raised and the execution of the command is aborted \-\-\-
\fBslide\-out\fP won\(aqt attempt rebase of the new downstream branches and \fBtraverse\fP won\(aqt continue the traversal.
In case of \fBadvance\fP there is no difference (other than exit code of the entire \fBadvance\fP command being non\-zero),
since slide\-out is the last operation that happens within \fBadvance\fP\&.
.sp
Note that non\-zero exit code of the hook doesn\(aqt cancel the effects of slide\-out itself, only the subsequent operations.
The hook is executed only once the slide\-out is complete and can in fact rely on .git/machete file being updated to the new branch layout.
.TP
.B \fBmachete\-pre\-rebase <new\-base> <fork\-point\-hash> <branch\-being\-rebased>\fP
The hook that is executed before rebase is run during \fBreapply\fP, \fBslide\-out\fP, \fBtraverse\fP and \fBupdate\fP\&.
Note that it is NOT executed by \fBsquash\fP (despite its similarity to \fBreapply\fP), since no rebase is involved in \fBsquash\fP\&.
.sp
The parameters are exactly the three revisions that are passed to \fBgit rebase \-\-onto\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
what is going to be the new base for the rebased commits,
.IP 2. 3
what is the fork point \-\-\- the place where the rebased history diverges from the upstream history,
.IP 3. 3
what branch is rebased.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the hook returns a non\-zero exit code, an error is raised and the entire rebase is aborted.
.sp
Note: this hook is independent from git\(aqs standard \fBpre\-rebase hook\fP\&.
If machete\-pre\-rebase returns zero, the execution flow continues to \fBgit rebase\fP, which may also run \fBpre\-rebase hook\fP if present.
\fBmachete\-pre\-rebase\fP is thus always launched before \fBpre\-rebase\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBmachete\-status\-branch <branch\-name>\fP
The hook that is executed for each branch displayed during \fBdiscover\fP, \fBstatus\fP and \fBtraverse\fP\&.
.sp
The standard output of this hook is displayed at the end of the line, after branch name, (optionally) custom annotation and
(optionally) remote sync\-ness status. Standard error is ignored. If the hook returns a non\-zero exit code, both stdout and stderr
are ignored, and printing the status continues as usual.
.sp
Note: the hook is always invoked with \fBASCII_ONLY\fP variable passed into the environment.
If \fBstatus\fP runs in ASCII\-only mode (if \fB\-\-color=auto\fP and stdout is NOT a terminal, or if \fB\-\-color=never\fP),
then \fBASCII_ONLY=true\fP, otherwise \fBASCII_ONLY=false\fP\&.

Apart from simply ASCII\-formatting the branch layout file, this also:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
colors the edges between upstream (parent) and downstream (children) branches:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
red edge means \fInot in sync\fP\&. The downstream branch is NOT a direct descendant of the upstream branch.
.IP \(bu 2
yellow edge means \fIin sync but fork point off\fP\&. The downstream branch is a direct descendant of the upstream branch,
but the \fI\%fork point\fP of the downstream branch is NOT equal to the upstream branch.
.IP \(bu 2
green edge means \fIin sync\fP\&. The downstream branch is a direct descendant of the upstream branch
and the fork point of the downstream branch is equal to the upstream branch.
.IP \(bu 2
grey/dimmed edge means \fImerged\fP\&. The downstream branch has been merged to the upstream branch,
detected by commit equivalency (default), or by strict detection of merge commits (if \fB\-\-no\-detect\-squash\-merges\fP passed).
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
prints (\fBuntracked\fP/\fBahead of <remote>\fP/\fBbehind <remote>\fP/\fBdiverged from [& older than] <remote>\fP) message if the branch
is not in sync with its remote counterpart;
.IP \(bu 2
displays the custom annotations (see help for \fI\%format\fP and \fI\%anno\fP) next to each branch, if present. Annotations might contain underlined branch
qualifiers (\fBpush=no\fP, \fBrebase=no\fP, \fBslide\-out=no\fP) that control rebase and push behavior of \fBtraverse\fP (see help for \fI\%traverse\fP);
.IP \(bu 2
displays the output of \fBmachete\-status\-branch hook\fP (see help for \fI\%hooks\fP), if present;
.IP \(bu 2
optionally lists commits introduced on each branch if \fB\-l/\-\-list\-commits\fP or \fB\-L/\-\-list\-commits\-with\-hashes\fP is supplied.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Name of the currently checked\-out branch is underlined (or shown in blue on terminals that don\(aqt support underline).
.sp
In case of yellow edge, use \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP flag to show the exact location of the inferred fork point
(which indicates, among other things, what range of commits is going to be rebased when the branch is updated).
The inferred fork point can be always overridden manually, see help for \fI\%fork\-point\fP\&.
.sp
Grey/dimmed edge suggests that the downstream branch can be slid out (see help for \fI\%slide\-out\fP and \fI\%traverse\fP).
.sp
Use of colors can be disabled with a \fB\-\-color\fP flag set to \fBnever\fP\&.
With \fB\-\-color=always\fP, git machete always emits colors.
With \fB\-\-color=auto\fP (the default), it emits colors only when standard output is connected to a terminal.
When colors are disabled, relation between branches is represented in the following way (not including the hash\-comments):
.INDENT 0.0

By default \fBtraverse\fP asks if the branch should be pushed. This behavior can, however, be changed with the \fBmachete.traverse.push\fP configuration key.
It can also be customized using options: \fB\-\-[no\-]push\fP or \fB\-\-[no\-]push\-untracked\fP \-\-\- the order of the flags defines their precedence over each other
(the one on the right overriding the ones on the left). More on them in the \fBOptions\fP section below.
.sp
If the traverse flow is stopped (typically due to merge/rebase conflicts), just run \fBgit machete traverse\fP after the merge/rebase is finished.
It will pick up the walk from the current branch.
Unlike with \fBgit rebase\fP or \fBgit cherry\-pick\fP, there is no special \fB\-\-continue\fP flag, as \fBtraverse\fP is stateless.
\fBtraverse\fP does \fBnot\fP keep a state of its own like \fBgit rebase\fP does in \fB\&.git/rebase\-apply/\fP\&.
.sp
The rebase, push and slide\-out behaviors of \fBtraverse\fP can also be customized for each branch separately using \fIbranch qualifiers\fP\&.
There are \fBpush=no\fP, \fBrebase=no\fP and \fBslide\-out=no\fP qualifiers that can be used to opt out of default behavior (rebasing, pushing and sliding the branch out).
The qualifier can appear anywhere in the annotation, but needs to be separated by a whitespace from any other character, as in: \fBsome_annotation_text rebase=no push=no slide\-out=no\fP\&.
Qualifiers can only be overwritten by manually editing \fB\&.git/machete\fP file or modifying it with \fBgit machete e[dit]\fP, or by updating annotations with \fBgit machete anno\fP\&.
Example machete file with branch qualifiers:
