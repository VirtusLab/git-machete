**git machete is a versatile tool for organizing your git repo, including features like:**

* Neat, customizable `git machete status` that shows what branches are in sync with their parent branch/remote tracking branch and which of them need to be rebased/merged/pulled/pushed

* Semi-automatic traversal of the branches that helps you effortlessly rebase, merge, push and pull the branches you care for (`git machete traverse`)

* Automatic discovery of branch relations (`git machete discover`)

We suggest a couple of alternative ways of installation.

**Bash and zsh completion scripts are provided** in completion/ directory, see [wiki for their installation instructions](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/wiki).

git-machete works under both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.

### Using PPA (Ubuntu)

Tip: run `sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common` first if `add-apt-repository` is not available on your system.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:virtuslab/git-machete
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-git-machete
```

### Using rpm (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/openSUSE...)

Download the rpm package from the [latest release](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/releases/latest)
and install either by opening it in your desktop environment or with `rpm -i git-machete-*.noarch.rpm`.

### Using AUR (Arch Linux)

Install the AUR package [git-machete](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-machete) using an AUR helper of your preference.

### Using Nix (macOS & most Linux distributions)

On macOS and most Linux distributions, you can install via [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/):

```bash
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable unstable  # if you haven't set up any channels yet
nix-env -i git-machete
```

### Using pip with sudo (system-wide install)

You need to have Python and `pip` installed from system packages.

```bash
sudo -H pip install git-machete
```

### Using pip without sudo (user-wide install)

It can also be installed via Ubuntu Software. Search for `git-machete`

## Quick start

```bash
cd your-repo/
git machete discover --checked-out-since='2 weeks ago'  # increase/decrease the timespan if you want more/less old branches included
  # (see and possibly edit the suggested layout of branches - branch layout is always kept as text file .git/machete)
git machete traverse --fetch --start-from=first-root
  # (put each branch one by one in sync with its parent and remote counterpart)
```
