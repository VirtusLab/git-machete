## Run tests locally

To develop that project and run tests locally, it is needed to have Python installed with `tox`.

Use `tox -e venv` to setup virtual environment to work on that project in your favorite IDE.
Use `.tox/venv/bin/python` as a reference `python` interpreter in your IDE.

To run tests, execute `tox`.


## Generate sandbox repositories

Run `docs/setup-sandbox` script to set up a test repo under `~/machete-sandbox` with a remote in `~/machete-sandbox-remote`.


## Command properties/classification

Deprecated commands are excluded.

[1]: `github` can only display status, accept interactive mode or modify git repository when `create-pr` or `checkout-prs` subcommand is passed.

[2]: `advance` can only run fast-forward merge (`git merge --ff-only`).

[3]: `reapply` can run rebase but can't run merge since merging a branch with its own fork point is a no-op and generally doesn't make much sense.

[4]: A stable output is only guaranteed for `fork-point` when invoked without any option or only with `--inferred` option.


## Versioning

This tool is [semantically versioned](https://semver.org) with respect to all of the following:

* Python and Git version compatibility
* command-line interface (commands and their options)
* format of its specific files (currently just `machete` file within git directory)
* hooks and their interface
* output format of plumbing commands (see above for the list)
* accepted environment variables

Output format of any non-plumbing command can change in non-backward-compatible manner even between patch-level updates.

## FAQ's about Pull Requests
**What is the proper base for pull request?**

Please set the base of pull request to `develop` branch. Current branch protection rules on GitHub only allow to merge `develop` or `hotfix` branches into `master`.

**Who closes GitHub comments? Author of changes, reviewer or initiator of the conversation?**

It makes sense to close comment:

1) If the comment was trivial and was addressed as suggested by the reviewer, then it is enough for the PR author to simply `Resolve` the thread and that's it
2) If the comment was not trivial and/or for some reason the PR author believes that the comment should not be addressed as suggested by the reviewer, then it is best to leave the thread open after replying; then the reviewer can press `Resolve` once they have decided that the matter is cleared.

**Do you make squash before develop?**

Any technique is okay as long as there are [NO unnecessary merge commits](https://slides.com/plipski/git-machete#/8).
`Squash and merge` from GitHub is okay, fast-forward made from console or via `git machete advance` & `git push` is ok too.

**Is there any commit message convention?**

Nothing special, as long as they look neat in the sense that they are written in imperative form and describe what actually happened on a given commit.

**How do you know that the comment has been approved?**

As in the first point, if the PR author accepts the suggested comment without any additional comments, simply `Resolve` on Github will suffice. There is no need to reply things like "Accepted", "Done", etc as it just spams the reviewer's email.

**Can I resolve all comments in a single commit or each comment in an individual commit?**

Review fixes should be pushed on separate commits for easier viewing on GitHub (unlike in e.g. Gerrit's amend-based flow).


## Release TODO list

1. Create release PR from `develop` into `master`.

1. Verify that all checks have passed.

1. Merge develop into master and push to remote repository using console:

         git checkout develop
         git pull origin develop
         git checkout master
         git pull origin master
         git merge --no-ff develop
         git push origin master

1. Verify that the release has been created on [GitHub](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/releases)
   and that a `git-machete-<VERSION>-1.noarch.rpm` file is present under the Assets.

1. Verify that the latest version is uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/git-machete).

1. Verify that the latest commit in [VirtusLab/homebrew-git-machete](https://github.com/VirtusLab/homebrew-git-machete) tap repo refers to the latest version.

1. Verify that a Docker image for the new version has been pushed to Docker Hub: [gitmachete/git-machete](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitmachete/git-machete/tags).

1. Verify that a build started for [Snap](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/VirtusLab/git-machete).
   If not, check `snapcraft.io` webhook on GitHub (under Settings > Webhooks) &mdash;
   sometimes the Snap Store's build system responds with 500 status for no clear reason, in such case `Redeliver` the call.

   Once the build is ready, install the `latest/edge` revision locally (`sudo snap install --edge --classic git-machete`)
   and verify that it works correctly, esp. if it comes to push/pull via ssh/https and editor (`git machete edit` and interactive rebases).

   Then, perform a release from `latest/edge` to `latest/stable` for both `i386` and `amd64`
   from [Snapcraft web dashboard](https://snapcraft.io/git-machete/releases) or via CLI.

1. Verify that a build started for [docs at Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/git-machete/builds/).
   If not, check `readthedocs.org` webhook on GitHub (under Settings > Webhooks).

   Once the build is ready, verify the [doc contents](https://git-machete.readthedocs.io/en/stable).

1. Verify that a build started on [git-machete PPA](https://launchpad.net/~virtuslab/+archive/ubuntu/git-machete/+packages).

   Once the new version of package is published and the old one is removed (typically takes around 20-30 min),
   follow the instructions from [ci/deb-ppa-test-install/README.md](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/tree/master/ci/deb-ppa-test-install).
   Inspect the output of `docker-compose` and verify that the latest version gets correctly installed on Ubuntu (esp. see the output of `git machete --version`).

1. Thanks to the courtesy of [@blitz (Julian Stecklina)](https://github.com/blitz),
   a [git-machete package](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/git-machete/default.nix)
   lives in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) &mdash; the collection of packages for [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/).

   Since @blitz's [PR #131141 to NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/131141),
   automatic updates of this package (based on the package hosted on PyPI) should be performed by [@r-ryantm bot](https://github.com/r-ryantm).
   Verify that [version-bump PRs to NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+git-machete),
   are regularly opened so that Nix package is kept up to date with git-machete releases.

   If package-update PR has not been opened for a long time, it's probably due to the failure of Nix package build.
   Check [r-ryantm build system](https://r.ryantm.com/log/updatescript/git-machete/) for recent build logs.

   a [git-machete package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-machete) is hosted in Arch User Repository (AUR).
   If the release introduces significant changes/critical bugfixes, please [flag the package as out of date](https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/git-machete/flag).
