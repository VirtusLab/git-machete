# Contributing

## PyCharm setup

Make sure the following bundled plugins are enabled:
* Docker
* Git
* Markdown
* Ini
* IntelliLang (for language injections, e.g. Markdown/shell scripts in YAML)
* ReStructuredText
* Shell Script (also: agree to enable Shellcheck when asked)
* YAML

Optionally, you can also install the following non-bundled plugins from Marketplace:
* [AWK Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17037-awk-support)
* [NixIDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8607-nixidea)
* [Requirements](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10837-requirements/)


## Git setup

From the main project folder, run the following commands:

```shell
ln -s ../../hook_samples/machete-status-branch .git/hooks/machete-status-branch
ln -s ../../hook_samples/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
ln -s ../../ci/checks/run-all-checks.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Install `fish` and `shellcheck` for `run-all-checks.sh` to pass successfully.

## Run tests locally

To run tests in terminal, it is required to have at least one Python interpreter version installed with `tox`, available versions are 3.{6-11}.
To run all tests, execute `tox` (requires each Python 3.X version previously specified), to run selected test environment execute `tox -e test_env_name` ---
the name of the `test_env_name` can specify Python version of the environment, e.g. `py37`, if the `tox` can't discover version from the name, the highest version currently installed will be used.

## Install locally for development purposes

### Terminal: venv

To execute `git-machete` commands in terminal using current branch implementation, you must first have a virtual environment.
You can create one named `venv` by executing `tox -e venv` or use existing environment (need to install requirements from [requirements.testenv.txt](requirements.testenv.txt)).
You have to activate the environment, for the `venv` environment run `source .tox/venv/bin/activate` from `git-machete` root directory.
Lastly, install `git-machete` in development mode with `pip install --editable .` --- codebase can now be edited in-place without reinstallation.

### Terminal: user-wide installation

Use `pip install --user .`. Locate the installed package with `pip show -f git-machete` --- you'll see something like:

```
<...metadata...>
Location: /Users/pawel_lipski/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages
Requires:
Required-by:
Files:
  <...files...>
  ../../../bin/git-machete
  <...files...>
```

Compound the `Location` with the relative path to `bin/git-machete` launcher script to locate the directory where the launcher script is located.
In the above macOS example, it'll be `$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin`.
On Linuxes, it's likely to be `$HOME/.local/bin` instead.
Add this directory to `PATH`.
Re-installation will be needed after a modification, as `--editable` and `--user` don't seem to work together.

### IDE (PyCharm): venv

To execute tests in IDE (e.g. PyCharm -> right-clicking on the test file or clicking the green triangle on the left of the test case name),
you must first have a virtual environment. You can create one named `venv` by executing `tox -e venv` or use existing environment
(but then you need to install requirements from [requirements.testenv.txt](requirements.testenv.txt)).
Lastly, setup `python` interpreter for your project in the IDE, e.g. `.tox/venv/bin/python`.

To run/debug `git-machete` commands directly in IDE you need to create custom *Run/Debug Configuration*: set *Script Path* e.g. to [`git_machete/cli.py`](git_machete/cli.py)
and provide command as *Parameters*.


## Generate sandbox repositories

Run [`graphics/setup-sandbox`](graphics/setup-sandbox) script to set up a test repo under `~/machete-sandbox` with a remote in `~/machete-sandbox-remote`.


## Regenerate the GIF in README.md

1. Install [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema),
   [agg (at least v1.4.1)](https://github.com/asciinema/agg),
   and [sponge](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sponge).
   On macOS, just `brew install asciinema agg sponge` should be enough.
1. Run [`./graphics/generate-asciinema-gif graphics/discover-status-traverse.gif`](graphics/generate-asciinema-gif).

[1]: `github` can only display status, accept interactive mode or modify git repository when `create-pr` or `checkout-prs` subcommand is passed.

[2]: `advance` can only run fast-forward merge (`git merge --ff-only`).

[3]: `reapply` can run rebase but can't run merge since merging a branch with its own fork point is a no-op and generally doesn't make much sense.

[4]: A stable output is only guaranteed for `fork-point` when invoked without any option or only with `--inferred` option.


## Versioning

This tool is [semantically versioned](https://semver.org) with respect to all of the following:

* Python and Git version compatibility
* command-line interface (commands and their options)
* format of its specific files (currently just `machete` file within git directory)
* hooks and their interface
* output format of plumbing commands (see above for the list)
* accepted environment variables

Output format of any [non-plumbing command](#command-propertiesclassification) can change in a non-backward-compatible manner even between patch-level updates.

## FAQ about Pull Requests

#### What is the proper base for pull request?

Please set the base of pull request to `develop` branch.
Current branch protection rules on GitHub only allow to merge `develop` or `hotfix/*` branches into `master`.

#### Who closes GitHub comments? Author of changes, reviewer or initiator of the conversation?

It makes sense to close comment:

1) If the comment was trivial and was addressed as suggested by the reviewer,
   then it is enough for the PR author to simply `Resolve` the thread and that's it.
2) If the comment was not trivial and/or for some reason the PR author believes that the comment should not be addressed as suggested by the reviewer,
   then it is best to leave the thread open after replying; then the reviewer can press `Resolve` once they have decided that the matter is cleared.

#### Do you make squash before develop?

Any technique is okay as long as there are [NO unnecessary merge commits](https://slides.com/plipski/git-machete#/8).
`Squash and merge` from GitHub is okay, fast-forward made from console or via `git machete advance` is okay too.

#### Is there any commit message convention?

Nothing special, as long as they look neat in the sense that they are written in the [imperative form](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative)
and describe what actually happened on a given commit.

#### How do you know that the comment has been approved?

As in the first point, if the PR author accepts the suggested comment without any additional comments, simply `Resolve` on GitHub will suffice.
There is no need to reply things like "Accepted", "Done", etc. as it just spams the reviewer's mailbox.

#### Can I resolve all comments in a single commit or each comment in an individual commit?

Review fixes should be pushed on separate commits for easier viewing on GitHub (unlike in e.g. Gerrit's amend-based flow).


## Release TODO list

1. Create release PR from `develop` into `master`.

1. Verify that all checks have passed.

1. Merge develop into master and push to remote repository using console (**not** using GitHub Merge Button):

         git checkout develop
         git pull origin develop
         git checkout master
         git pull origin master
         git merge --ff-only develop
         git push origin master

1. Verify that the release has been created on [GitHub](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/releases)
   and that a `git-machete-<VERSION>-1.noarch.rpm` file is present under the Assets.

1. Verify that the latest version is uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/git-machete).

1. Verify that the latest version is uploaded to [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/git-machete).
   Thanks to the courtesy of [@asford (Alex Ford)](https://github.com/asford),
   there exists [conda-forge/git-machete-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/git-machete-feedstock) repository.
   A bot is responsible for keeping the package up-to-date based on PyPI's release.
   Instruction on how to be a maintainer and other helpful tips can be found in
   [conda-forge recipe maintainer docs](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html#recipe-maintainer).

1. Verify that there is an open PR in [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+git-machete) titled: `git-machete <latest_version>`.

1. Verify that a newly released version is present in `latest/stable` channel in [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/git-machete/releases).

   Install the `stable` revision locally (`sudo snap install --classic git-machete`)
   and verify that it works correctly, esp. if it comes to push/pull via ssh/https and editor (`git machete edit` and interactive rebases).

1. Verify that a build started for [docs at Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/git-machete/builds/).
   If not, check `readthedocs.org` webhook on GitHub (under Settings > Webhooks).

   Once the build is ready, verify the [doc contents](https://git-machete.readthedocs.io/en/stable).

1. Verify that a build started on [git-machete PPA](https://launchpad.net/~virtuslab/+archive/ubuntu/git-machete/+packages).

   Once the new version of package is published and the old one is removed (typically takes around 20-30 min),
   follow the instructions from [ci/deb-ppa-test-install/README.md](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete/tree/master/ci/deb-ppa-test-install).
   Inspect the output of `docker-compose` and verify that the latest version gets correctly installed on Ubuntu (esp. see the output of `git machete --version`).

1. Thanks to the courtesy of [@blitz (Julian Stecklina)](https://github.com/blitz),
   a [git-machete package](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-machete/default.nix)
   lives in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) &mdash; the collection of packages for [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/).

   Since @blitz's [PR #131141 to NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/131141),
   automatic updates of this package (based on the package hosted on PyPI) should be performed by [@r-ryantm bot](https://github.com/r-ryantm).
   Verify that [version-bump PRs to NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+git-machete),
   are regularly opened so that Nix package is kept up to date with git-machete releases.

   If package-update PR has not been opened for a long time, it's probably due to the failure of Nix package build.
   Check [r-ryantm build system](https://r.ryantm.com/log/updatescript/git-machete/) for recent build logs.
