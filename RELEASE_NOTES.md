# Release notes

## New in git-machete 3.30.0

- added: support for Python 3.13 (earlier versions of git-machete should work on earlier Python versions outside of certain rare cases when in `--debug` mode)

## New in git-machete 3.29.3

- changed: no longer publish RPM files with GitHub releases
- fixed: work around the parsing bug in `git patch-id` v2.46.1 (reported by @ilai-deutel)
- fixed: `git machete git{hub,lab} create-{pr,mr}` takes into account `<!-- {start,end} git-machete generated -->` in PR/MR template (suggested by @frank-west-iii)

## New in git-machete 3.29.2

- changed: no longer publish Docker images

## New in git-machete 3.29.1

## New in git-machete 3.29.0

- added: git config keys `machete.github.prDescriptionIntroStyle` and `machete.gitlab.mrDescriptionIntroStyle`
- added: ability to turn off PR/MR description intro completely by setting the git config key to `none` (suggested by @tir38)
- added: ability to include downstream PRs/MRs in PR/MR description intro by setting the git config key to `full` (suggested by @aouaki)
- changed: layout and ordering of PRs/MRs in PR/MR description intro to better match `git machete status`

## New in git-machete 3.28.0

## New in git-machete 3.26.4

- fixed: avoid detecting a cycle when there's a PR/MR from `main` or `master` in a fork to the original repo (reported by @Joibel)
- fixed: `git machete git{hub,lab} create-{pr,mr}` no longer fails when creating a PR/MR across forks; instead, a forked PR is created (reported by @cspotcode)

- improved: message in case of missing `.git/machete` file suggests to use `git machete git{hub,lab} checkout-{prs,mrs}`
- fixed: pass `-c log.showSignature=false` to all `git` invocations to hide GPG signatures in logs; if `log.showSignature` were set to a value equivalent to `true` in a user's `git` configuration, the GPG signatures shown in logs would cause errors in `git log` and `git reflog` parsing internal to `git machete` (reported and contributed by @goxberry)

## New in git-machete 3.23.1

- fixed: if a PR has a pre-v3.23.0 `Based on PR #...` header, then it's removed by `git machete github retarget-pr` in favor of the new extended PR chain

## New in git-machete 3.23.0

- added: full chain of PRs (and not just a link to the base PR) is added to/updated in PR description by `git machete github create-pr`/`retarget-pr`/`restack-pr` (suggested by @mjgigli)

## New in git-machete 3.22.0

- added: `--yes` flag to `git machete github create-pr` so that the user isn't asked whether to push the branch (suggested by @mkondratek)
- deprecated: `git machete clean` and `git machete github sync`; use `github checkout-prs --mine`, `delete-unmanaged` and `slide-out --removed-from-remote` instead
- fixed: PR author is now always added to annotation if different from current user (contributed by @guyboltonking)

## New in git-machete 3.20.0
